# ECS Lambda Converter Tool:

This is an open source project to build your very own webapp conversion tool.
- Currently to convert PDF to Doc and MP4 to MP3.
- Runs off of Lambda and is hosted through AWS ECS.
- Runs of off CloudFront for both access and security.

The goal with this project is to apply what I have learned to build a new webapp securely and effectively.
