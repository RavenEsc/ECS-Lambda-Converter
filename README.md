# ECS Lambda Converter Tool:

This is an open-source project to build a webapp conversion tool.
- Plan to currently to convert PDF to Doc and MP4 to MP3.
- Will run off of Lambda and is hosted through AWS ECS.
- Will run off of CloudFront for both access and security.

The goal with this project is to apply what I have learned to build a new webapp securely and effectively.
